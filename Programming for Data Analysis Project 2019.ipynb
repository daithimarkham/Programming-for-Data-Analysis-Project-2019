    "\n",
    "- For this project we will be creating a data set, by simulating a real-world phenomenon of your choosing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You might pick one that is of interest to you in your personal or professional life.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Then, rather than collect data related to the phenomenon, you should model and synthesise such data using Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We will be using the numpy.random package, a sub package of Python, for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Specifically, in this project you should:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook â€“ the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook."
