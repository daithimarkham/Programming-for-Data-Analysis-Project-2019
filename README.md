# Topic: Create a Synthesized Data-Set.


Create a data set by simulating a real-world phenomenon of your choosing. Then, rather than collect data related to the phenomenon, you should model and synthesize such data using the Python sub package, Numpy.random.

Jupyter Notebook, and how to use one for this project.
For this assignment we will be using a Jupyter notebook to write the functions within numpy.random and explain our code.

How to get started and run Jupyter Notebook.

• Create a new repository on Github, name it, initialize a ReadMe, Add.gitignore-Python, license, and click on clone/download and copy the link.

• Go to your command line, cd desktop, and type: git clone, space and right click. Creates folder you just created on Github.

• CD into folder, type Jupyter Notebook, which is older but more reliable, press enter, opens a browser, click on Notebook Python 3.

• Rename file.

• Type in some code and hold down shift and hit enter to display the code. Save!

• Shut down browser. (When you want to re-use or open up Jupyter again, re-start the kernel and run all cells, previous code might not work otherwise, which you had entered.)

• Go to command line, control plus c and release. Clears Python and and goes back to (master-origin).

• Git status

• Git add .

• Git commit –m “Name of what you created or done”.

• Git push

• Repository, ReadMe and Gitignore created.

Please find in the Jupyter Notebook file, a simulated dataset based on a phenomena, will is absenteeism in this case.
