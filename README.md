# Topic: Create a Synthesized Data-Set. 


Create a data set by simulating a real-world phenomenon of your choosing, can be something of interest to you in your personal or professional life. Then, rather than collect data related to the phenomenon, you should model and synthesize such data using the Python sub package, Numpy.random. This python package will generate random data.

The phenomenom we will be using to create our sythesized dataset is **Unplanned Absenteeism** from the workplace.

### How to get started and run Jupyter Notebook.

- Jupyter Notebook, and how to use one for this project.

For this project we will be using a Jupyter notebook for our simulated dataset, using numpy.random to generate our data. You will also need to download Anaconda, and the terminal which we will be using is going to be Commander.

• Create a new repository on Github, name it, initialize a ReadMe, Add.gitignore-Python, license, and click on clone/download and copy the link.

• Go to your command line, cd desktop, and type: git clone, space and right click. Creates a folder you just created on Github.

• CD into folder, type Jupyter Notebook, which is older but more reliable version, press enter, opens a browser, click on Notebook Python 3.

• Rename file.

• Type in some code in the cell, hold down shift and hit enter to display the code, and save! If you want to use markdown, click on the outer left part of the cell, escape and m, this will change the cell to markdown. 

• Shut down browser. (When you want to re-use or open up Jupyter again, re-start the kernel and run all cells, previous code might not work otherwise, which you had entered.)

• Go to command line, control plus c and release. Clears Python and and goes back to (master-origin).

• Git status

• Git add .

• Git commit –m “Name of what you created or done”.

• Git push

• Repository, ReadMe and Gitignore created.

**Please find in the Jupyter Notebook file, a simulated dataset based on a phenomena, which is based on absenteeism from the workplace.**
