    "- For this project we will be creating a data set, by simulating a real-world phenomenon of your choosing.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Then, rather than collect data related to the phenomenon, you should model and synthesise such data using Python.\n",

    "- We will be using the numpy.random package, a sub package of Python, for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In this project you should:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook â€“ the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.\n",

Synthetic data is created algorithmically, and it is used as a stand-in for test datasets of production or operational data, to validate mathematical models and, increasingly, to train machine learning models.(SEARCH CIO, 2019)"

    "For this project, the real-world phenomenom I will be using is running, and all the negative factors which effect runner's. There are a huge amount of factors that can be negative when a person exercises regularly, running in this case. Depends on the lifestyle, body weight, smoker or non-smoker etc. The variables I will be using for this synthetic data-set will be, training, smoker or non, cramps, dehydration, environment (flat/hills). It is very important for a runner to understand all these factors in ordr to be able to perform at the best of their ability. If you undertand the problems which effects runners, you will be able to prevent injuries from occuring. \n",
