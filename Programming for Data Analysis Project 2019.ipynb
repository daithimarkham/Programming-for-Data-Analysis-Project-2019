    "- For this project we will be creating a data set, by simulating a real-world phenomenon of your choosing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You might pick one that is of interest to you in your personal or professional life.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Then, rather than collect data related to the phenomenon, you should model and synthesise such data using Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We will be using the numpy.random package, a sub package of Python, for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In this project you should:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook â€“ the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.\n",

    "For this project, the real-world phenomenom I will be using is running, and all the negative factors which effect runners, as it is an area which effected me when I began running. There are a huge amount of factors that can be negative when a person exercises regularly, running in this case. Depends on the lifestyle, body weight, smoker or non-smoker etc. The variables I will be using for this synthetic data-set will be, age, gender, weight, training, track, smoker or non smoker. It is very important for a runner to understand all these factors in order to be able to perform at the best of your ability while training for a race or marathon. If you undertand the problems which effects runners, you will be able to prevent injuries from occuring. The figure we will be using to generate our simulated data-set is 100 runners.\n",
